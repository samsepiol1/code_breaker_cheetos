## About the Promotion

In 2020, Cheetos launched a promotional campaign featuring Pac-Man-themed tazos. The promotion was part of a larger marketing campaign by the brand, which aimed to appeal to nostalgia and capture the attention of younger consumers.

The tazos were available in packs of Cheetos snacks, and each pack came with one Pac-Man tazo. There were a total of six different tazos to collect, featuring different characters and elements from the classic Pac-Man video game.

To promote the campaign, Cheetos created a TV commercial that featured animated versions of the Pac-Man characters. The ad showed the characters playing a game of Tazo Mania, the classic game that was popularized by the original tazo craze of the 1990s.

The Pac-Man tazo promotion was well-received by fans of the classic video game, as well as by those who had fond memories of collecting tazos in their youth. The promotion was a successful way for Cheetos to tap into the nostalgia trend and connect with consumers on a more emotional level.****
